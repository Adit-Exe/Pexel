# Pexel
[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) provides high quality and completely free stock photos licensed under the Pexels license. All photos are nicely tagged, searchable and also easy to discover through our discover pages. And I used their api for my project.

The [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/) enables programmatic access to the full Pexels content library, including photos, videos. All content is available free of charge, and you are welcome to use Pexels content for anything you'd like, as long as it is within our Guidelines. The Pexels API is a RESTful JSON API, and you can interact with it from any language or framework with a HTTP library. Alternately, Pexels maintains some official Client Libraries you can use.


I used their API and build my project.
